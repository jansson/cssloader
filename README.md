CssLoader
=========

Really simple CSS based loader graphic weighing in at 26 rows (not counting vendor prefixes). It does not provide a fallback for unsupported browsers.

Example
-------

Usage
-----
    <div class="loader"></div>

Browser Support
---------------
The method relies and CSS animations and rounded borders, so any browsers supporting that should be green.
